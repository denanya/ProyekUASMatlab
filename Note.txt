Note:
Remember to add MeanShift to Matlab library in order to make the program work

BatchLungRegionExtraction.m  -  Batch process the lung slices and output lung region extraction images in specific path
BatchFeatureExtraction.m  -  Process the lung slices and extract three features and output a feature vector
EvaluateModel.m  -  Evaluate the model with cross-validation and mean accuracy
Preprocess.m  -  Batch process the ct scans, filter some useless scans and output ten bmp images for each patient in specific path
TrainModel.m  -  Apply FeatureExtractionV2.m, extract feature matrix and store in specific path
NoduleCandidate.m  -  Apply MeanShift algorithm
